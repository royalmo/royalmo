# Hi 👋, I'm Eric.
I'm a student, and a developper in my free time.

### What am I doing?

- 🌱 I’m currently studying **engineering** .

- 🔭 I’m working on small own projects in my free time.

- 👨‍💻 All of my projects are available at [ericroy.net](https://ericroy.net)

- 📫 You can reach me at [eric@ericroy.net](mailto:eric@ericroy.net)

- ⚡ Fun fact: no, there are no fun facts.


### What types of projects?

Although you will see them in much more detail in my website, I work a lot with **Python** (using Discord.py, Tkinter, Telepot, ... ). As I love this language, I've also done things in Java, C#, C++, JS, and many more.

I am now planning to get better skills with **Unity**, and everything that is involved into it: music composition, 3D designs, C# coding, animations...

Here you will all my public GitHub projects (not all of them have an article on my website).


### HELP! My computer isn't working...

Well, there's a simple solution that every dev will tell you. If you are on Linux, open a terminal prompt and type:
```
sudo reboot
```
It may ask your password, but don't worry. Everything should be fine after the restart (except it's a real issue with your computer).
