# Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Eric.
I'm a student and sometimes program stuff.

### Why am I reading this?

First, because you entered in my GitHub profile. What a stalker!

Second, because royalmo/royalmo is a âœ¨special âœ¨ repository that I can use to add a README.md to my GitHub profile!

### Ok, I'm here to stalk. Who are you?

I'm Eric, didn't you see the title? ...oh, you need more info, I see.

Well, you can always contact me at eric@ericroy.net to ask me anything you want.

### So, if you don't tell anything about you, what's the purpose of this?

I wanted my GitHub profile to have a README, that's all. I don't think that a very prepared text will make a difference in getting a job or not.

But, what *will* make a difference is my projects listed below. Please note that they've been done in my free time, and aren't perfect.
I just make some repositories public because I think someone might be interested in some code snippets (and to feed GitHub Copilot's AI).
